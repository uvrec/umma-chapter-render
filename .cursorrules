# VEDAVOICE.ORG — AI Rules

You are working on VEDAVOICE.ORG - a spiritual reading platform.

## CRITICAL DESIGN RULES

### NEVER USE:
- Card components (except for book covers in library)
- border, shadow, rounded with background
- border-t, border-b dividers
- overflow: hidden on html/body/#root (breaks sticky header!)

### ALWAYS USE:
- bg-background (transparent)
- Typography hierarchy for structure
- Space (margin/padding) for separation
- Clean text like in a book

## STICKY HEADER - MANDATORY

The header MUST always be sticky. Never change these CSS rules:

```css
.site-header {
  position: -webkit-sticky !important;
  position: sticky !important;
  top: 0 !important;
  z-index: 50 !important;
}
```

Use `overflow-x: clip` instead of `overflow-x: hidden`.

## PROTECTED FILES

Do not modify without explicit request:
- src/index.css
- src/components/Header.tsx
- src/styles/fonts.css
- tailwind.config.ts

## HOMEPAGE RULES

No Cards, no StatsBar, no QuickActions with cards.
Keep it minimal like a book cover.

## AUDIO PLAYER

Fullscreen layout, NOT a card.
