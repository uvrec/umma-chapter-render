    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>On November 15th, 1975, we arrived in Vṛndāvana, the most sacred of all holy places for Vaiṣṇavas. This is the land where Lord Kṛṣṇa performed His childhood pastimes five thousand years ago.</p>

        <p>The atmosphere in Vṛndāvana is unlike anywhere else in the world. The very dust is considered sacred, and devotees roll in it to receive blessings. The trees, the cows, the Yamunā River—everything reminds one of Kṛṣṇa.</p>

        <h2>November 16th, 1975</h2>

        <p>Early morning <em>parikramā</em> (circumambulation) began at 4:30 a.m. Despite his advanced age, Śrīla Prabhupāda walked briskly through the narrow lanes of Vṛndāvana, pointing out various sacred sites.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"This is <em>Kālīya-ghāṭa</em>, where Kṛṣṇa danced on the hoods of the serpent Kālīya. By jumping from this tree, He subdued the poisonous snake and purified the waters of the Yamunā."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>We visited the <strong>Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma Mandira</strong>, ISKCON's magnificent temple that Prabhupāda had built. The white marble structure gleamed in the morning light, its domes reaching toward the sky like hands raised in prayer.</p>

        <h2>November 17th, 1975</h2>

        <p>Today was <em>Govardhana Pūjā</em>, commemorating Lord Kṛṣṇa's lifting of Govardhana Hill to protect the residents of Vṛndāvana from the wrath of Indra.</p>

        <p>Prabhupāda supervised the preparation of <em>annakūṭa</em>, a mountain of food offerings representing Govardhana Hill. Devotees had prepared over 108 different preparations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Various rice preparations</li>
            <li>Sweet dishes like <em>gulab jamun</em> and <em>rasagullā</em></li>
            <li>Savory items including <em>samosā</em> and <em>pakorā</em></li>
            <li>Fresh fruits and vegetables</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After the offering, Prabhupāda personally distributed <em>prasādam</em> to the assembled devotees and guests. His face radiated joy as he served.</p>

        <h2>November 18th, 1975</h2>

        <p>A delegation of local <em>paṇḍitas</em> came to meet Prabhupāda. They were curious about his successful preaching in the West and wanted to understand his methods.</p>

        <p>Prabhupāda explained:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"I have simply presented Kṛṣṇa's message as it is, without adulteration. The <em>paramparā</em> system is perfect. If we faithfully transmit the knowledge received from our spiritual master, it will have potency to transform hearts."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The <em>paṇḍitas</em> were impressed by his humility and scholarship. Several of them later became supporters of ISKCON's mission in Vṛndāvana.</p>
