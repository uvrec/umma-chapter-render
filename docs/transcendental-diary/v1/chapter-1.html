    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>In the early afternoon of November 10th, 1975, I walked into Śrīla Prabhupāda's sitting room to formally offer myself as his personal servant. He accepted me, thereby beginning a wonderful journey that would take me through twenty-three countries over the next sixteen months.</p>

        <p>It was a modest beginning. After offering my obeisances I placed a container of freshly made sweet rice, <em>kṣīra</em>, on his desk. Prabhupāda glanced down at it; he didn't say anything and neither did I. There was no need. He knew why I was there and I had been trained to do everything without discussion. I simply took up my service—it was as easy as that.</p>

        <p>So began my personal association with His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, the founder-ācārya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.</p>

        <h2>November 11th, 1975</h2>

        <p>The next morning I awoke at 3:30 a.m., excited at the prospect of my first full day of service. After attending <em>maṅgala-ārati</em> and <em>japa</em>, I went to Prabhupāda's rooms at about 6:30 a.m. to begin my duties.</p>

        <p>Śrīla Prabhupāda was already up, seated at his desk, working on his translation of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>. The room was dimly lit by a small lamp. He acknowledged my presence with a slight nod and continued his work.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The spiritual master is the representative of Kṛṣṇa. One who takes shelter of the spiritual master can make rapid advancement in spiritual life."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I quietly prepared his morning prasādam—fresh fruit, puffed rice, and warm milk—and set it on a small table beside him. He glanced at it briefly and continued writing.</p>

        <h2>November 12th, 1975</h2>

        <p>Today we made preparations for the journey to Kurukṣetra. This ancient battlefield, where Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> to Arjuna, held special significance.</p>

        <p>Prabhupāda explained the importance of this holy place:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Kurukṣetra is mentioned in the <em>Vedas</em> as <em>dharma-kṣetra</em>, the place of religious activities. Even today, during the solar eclipse, millions of people gather there for purification."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The car journey took several hours. Along the way, Prabhupāda pointed out various landmarks and explained their spiritual significance. His knowledge of Indian history and geography was remarkable.</p>

        <h2>November 13th, 1975</h2>

        <p>We arrived at Kurukṣetra in the afternoon. A large gathering of local devotees and curious onlookers had assembled to greet Prabhupāda. He stepped out of the car slowly, accepting garlands with a gracious smile.</p>

        <p>Standing on the very ground where the great battle of Mahābhārata was fought, Prabhupāda spoke powerfully:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"On this very spot, five thousand years ago, Kṛṣṇa instructed Arjuna in the science of self-realization. The message of the <em>Gītā</em> is as relevant today as it was then. We must learn to see ourselves as eternal souls, servants of Kṛṣṇa."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The crowd listened with rapt attention as he continued to explain the philosophy of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. Many asked questions, and Prabhupāda answered each one with patience and clarity.</p>

        <p>As the sun set over the sacred field, we returned to our accommodations. Prabhupāda seemed pleased with the day's events. He remarked that the seed of Kṛṣṇa consciousness had been planted in many hearts.</p>
