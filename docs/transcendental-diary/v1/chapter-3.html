    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>On December 1st, 1975, we returned to New Delhi for an important program. The city was bustling with preparations for the upcoming winter season.</p>

        <h2>December 2nd, 1975</h2>

        <p>Prabhupāda gave a powerful lecture at the Birla Mandir. Thousands of people had gathered to hear him speak on the science of the soul.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The body is like a dress. Just as we change our dress, the soul changes bodies. This is called transmigration of the soul."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>After the lecture, many people approached Prabhupāda with questions about spiritual life. He patiently answered each one, sometimes in Hindi, sometimes in English.</p>

        <h2>December 3rd, 1975</h2>

        <p>Today we visited the Parliament of India. Several MPs had invited Prabhupāda to discuss the role of spirituality in modern governance.</p>

        <p>Prabhupāda emphasized:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"A leader who is not God-conscious cannot give proper direction to the citizens. The first duty of government is to educate people in spiritual values."</p>
