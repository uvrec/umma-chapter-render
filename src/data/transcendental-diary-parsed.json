He accepted me, thereby beginning a wonderful journey that would take me through twenty-three countries over the next sixteen months.</p>\n\n<p>It was a modest beginning. After offering my obeisances I placed a container of freshly made sweet rice, <em>kṣīra</em>, on his desk. Prabhupada glanced down at it; he didn't say anything and neither did I. There was no need. He knew why I was there and I had been trained to do everything without discussion. I simply took up my service—it was as easy as that.</p>\n\n<p>So began my personal association with His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder-ācārya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.</p>",
